- **State Management**: Handles loading, error, and completion states
- **Security Checks**: Validates quote ownership and payment eligibility

### API Endpoints

#### 1. Deposit Payment API

Processes deposit payments and creates MedusaJS orders:

**POST** `/api/catering/payments/deposit`
- Validates payment data and quote status
- Verifies payment amount matches expected deposit
- Creates MedusaJS order for deposit
- Updates quote status to 'deposit_paid'
- Generates balance payment link
- Sends confirmation email

**GET** `/api/catering/payments/deposit`
- Returns deposit payment status for a quote
- Includes payment timeline and amounts

#### 2. Balance Payment API
**Location**: `/src/pages/api/catering/payments/balance.ts`

Processes balance payments and completes orders:

**POST** `/api/catering/payments/balance`
- Validates quote is ready for balance payment
- Verifies payment amount and security token
- Checks event hasn't passed
- Creates MedusaJS order for balance
- Updates quote status to 'completed'
- Sends order confirmation emails

**GET** `/api/catering/payments/balance`
- Returns balance payment status and timeline
- Validates access tokens for security

#### 3. Balance Link Email API
**Location**: `/src/pages/api/catering/payments/send-balance-link.ts`

Sends balance payment links via email:

**POST** `/api/catering/payments/send-balance-link`
- Validates quote and customer email
- Generates HTML email template
- Sends professional email with payment link
- Includes event details and urgency indicators

### Pages

#### Balance Payment Page
**Location**: `/src/pages/catering/balance-payment.astro`

Standalone page for balance payment collection:
- Accessible via secure payment links
- Handles URL parameters (quote ID and token)
- Provides customer support information
- Displays security and compliance notices

## Database Integration

### Quote Status Flow
```
pending → approved → deposit_paid → completed
```

### Database Fields
- `status`: Current quote status
- `medusa_order_id`: Deposit payment order ID
- `balance_order_id`: Balance payment order ID
- `updated_at`: Automatic timestamp updates

## Payment Provider Integration

### Stripe Integration

- Supports PaymentElement for modern payment methods
- Handles 3D Secure authentication
- Demo mode for development/testing

### Square Integration
- Uses existing SquarePaymentForm component
- Business-focused payment processing
- Integrated POS system compatibility
- Inventory and analytics tracking

## Security Features

### Token-Based Authentication
- Base64-encoded tokens for balance payment links
- Format: `base64(quoteId:customerEmail:timestamp)`
- Prevents unauthorized access to payment forms
- Time-sensitive link validation

### Payment Validation
- Amount verification against quote totals
- Status validation (must be in correct phase)
- Customer email matching
- Event date validation (no past events)

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error messages
- Retry mechanisms for failed payments
- Fallback support contact information
- Graceful degradation for network issues

## Email Notifications

### Deposit Confirmation
- Sent immediately after successful deposit
- Includes event details and balance information
- Professional HTML template with branding

### Balance Payment Link

## Error Handling & Recovery

### Payment Failures
- Detailed error messages from payment providers
- Retry mechanisms with fresh payment forms
- Support contact information
- Transaction ID tracking for debugging

### Network Issues
- Loading states with progress indicators
- Timeout handling with retry options
- Offline detection and messaging
- Graceful degradation to basic functionality

### Data Validation
- Schema validation using Zod
- Client-side form validation
- Server-side security checks
- Input sanitization and type safety

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Payment Tracking
- Transaction ID logging
- Payment provider identification
- Success/failure rate monitoring

## Development & Testing

### Demo Mode
- Mock payment processing for development
- Configurable success/failure scenarios
- No real charges in development environment
- Easy switching between test and live modes

### Environment Configuration
- Separate API keys for test/production
- Database isolation between environments
- Email service configuration per environment
- Payment provider sandbox/live switching
